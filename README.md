# 🙋 Contributing and suggesting shortcuts

mon.icu is a community driven project! Link proposals are very much appreciated and are always
considered by project maintainers. Feel free to submit your ideas via [issues][1] page or by
submitting a [pull request][2] that changes this file.

**Links that were suggested once will remain forever!** Until we find a way to notify link users
about link deprecation, **no links will be removed.** Please think your propositions through.

**Do not suggest links that are not related to DDLC, MAS or FoM!** We do not plan on using mon.icu
as a general audience link shortening service; only projects affiliated with the abovementioned
games/projects/organizations.
